>> There are two main executables:
    - proxy_stats := it outputs one file that counts the number of occurrences 
                     for each one of nine types of token. Each count per token
                     is separated by one line that contains a '#'. The extension
                     of output file is *.out.
    - stats_parser := sumarizes in a single file several proxy_stats outputed
                      files.


>> How to run:
   - proxy_stats receives as input a filename. example:  ./proxy_stats log_name.file 
     Then counts the number of appareances of each element inside each token type.
     This count is serialized in a file that has as name log_name.file.out
   - stats_parser receives as input several filenames. 
     example: ./stats_parser log1.file log2.file ... log3.file
